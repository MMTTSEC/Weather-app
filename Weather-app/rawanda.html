          Rwanda, officially the Republic of Rwanda, is a landlocked country in the Great Rift Valley of East Africa,
          where the African Great Lakes region and Southeast Africa converge. Located a few degrees south of the
          Equator, Rwanda is bordered by Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. <br>
          It is highly elevated, giving it the sobriquet "land of a thousand hills" (French: pays des mille collines),
          with its geography dominated by mountains in the west and savanna to the southeast, with numerous lakes
          throughout the country. The climate is temperate to subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons
          each year. It is the most densely populated mainland African country; among countries larger than 10,000 km2,
          it is the fifth-most densely populated country in the world. Its capital and largest city is Kigali.

              For a long time, the monarchy was mobile, moving the court between various locations. When it eventually settled in one place, Nyanza was the obvious choice. The capital of the kingdom had as many as 2,000 inhabitants, and huts built with the same methods as seen here.

            <div class="fw-bold">Rwanda, a small landlocked country in east-central Africa, is trying to recover from the ethnic strife that culminated in government-sponsored genocide in the mid-1990s.

              An estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by dominant Hutu forces in 100 days.

              Rwanda has striven to rebuild its economy, with coffee and tea production among its main exports, and economic development has helped reduce poverty and inequality.

            <div>
              Paul Kagame became president in 2000 and has effectively run Rwanda since 1994. While his government has maintained stability and economic growth, the US-based NGO Freedom House says it has also suppressed political dissent through intimidation, torture and suspected assassinations of exiled dissidents.
